** Origins of TODA
  
  Since 2017, Rudolf Jovero and Caleb Picker began developing TODA to address the ever-growing and -changing nature of the group.

** Why organize?

  Players are at the very core of tabletop games.
  At a minimum, playing tabletop games requires finding space and time to play and ensuring that players have something to do.
  This ensures that players can interact with each other in a comfortable setting, whether that means interacting with new people, discussing new board game ideas, or just having a comfortable space to meet with old friends.
  Meeting these essential functions on an ongoing basis requires establishing an organizational structure and a way to gather necessary resources.
  As more and more players gather to play, the social interactions also provide unique opportunities for players to collaborate, to teach and learn from each other, to create their own experiences, and to design and test new board games.
  Up until now, there has been no effective way to house, support, and develop player's various interests.
  Establishing an organization is therefore necessary to meet ongoing essential functions of playing tabletop games together as well as support those who want to collaborate and turn their ideas into something more tangible.
  Whatever the reason, establishing an organization provides a way to support each player's various interests.
    
** Why GitHub?

  The purpose of this GitHub repository is to host all the files required for establishing, maintaining, and working on the organization.
  GitHub is a collaborative tool that allows multiple users to interact with, share, discuss, and modify files, important documents, and ideas. 
  
  Typically, GitHub is used to host complex computer code projects that have many moving parts and people. 

  GitHub is the most transparent way to track all moving parts, with all considerations from all users and to best integrate them into the documentation.
