  ** Origins of TODA
  Since 2017, Rudolf Jovero and Caleb Picker began developing TODA to address the ever-growing and -changing nature of the group.

** Why organize?

  We are growing. Two years ago we started with only 4 people! 
  Now we have more than 16 people and counting coming to board game nights.
  We continue to attract new people, and we need a way to account for this continued growth.
  When you were once new, every one of you changed the group's dynamic when you joined.
  Going forward, each new person will continue to change the group dynamic.
  We want to make sure that growth comes healthy.
  This group should provide an improvement to each person's life--not an unnecessary obligation.

  Playing board games requires many resources and a way to allocate those resources as best as possible.
  All meetings, whether it's at a business or a person's residence, needs to be planned to accommodate for adequate space to play, for time to play, and to ensure that it is comfortable for everyone who attends.
  This requires, among others things, assessing each person's needs and interests and communicating information effectively, such as changes to locations and times.
  We need an efficient way to satisfy these functions, so that there is less uncertainty and more enjoyment for everyone.

  With 4-6 people, doing all of this takes less effort.
  However, our group will grow to potentially 30 or more people.
  With groups that grow, we still need to maintain the essential functions of the group: ensuring adequate space, ensuring there is time to play, and ensuring that everyone gets informed.
  This will become increasingly difficult without organization.
    
** Why GitHub?

  The purpose of this GitHub repository is to host all the files required for establishing, maintaining, and working on the organization.
  GitHub is a collaborative tool that allows multiple users to interact with, share, discuss, and modify files, important documents, and ideas. 
  
  Typically, GitHub is used to host complex computer code projects that have many moving parts and people. 

  GitHub is the most transparent way to track all moving parts, with all considerations from all users and to best integrate them into the documentation.

** Getting Started on Providing Feedback (and Choosing Your Level of Involvement)

You have two options to get started:

*** Suggestion Box
You can submit a response in the suggestion box. Anyone may use the suggestion box anonymously, so please provide your sincere feedback! 

After submission, we will make an issue with the request so that the issue can be tracked publicly.

Either you or we will add additional labels to categorize the issue.
Then anyone can comment and discuss the issue, and the entire discussion thread is publicly visible.

** Doing More
*** Forks and Pull Requests
If you want to directly contribute to documentation, you can 'fork' this repository.
A fork refers to copying this repository to your account.
You make a copy, then you are free to make any changes you want.
Eventually you can make a 'pull request' so that those changes can be reviewed.
Like issues, anyone can comment and discuss the pull request and finalize it.

To fork the repository:

1. On the repository page, click the button in the upper-right hand corner that says, 'fork'. GitHub will copy the repo to your account.
2. Create or edit files as you'd like.
3. Make a pull request by clicking 'New pull request'.
4. Fill out the title and description, like issues.
5. Click 'Create pull request'.

The community will then review and discuss.

*** Projects
Projects are used as a way to organize and implement large functions of the organization. Tasks, issues, and pull requests are organized within projects.

If you would like to get involved and manage one or more projects, please contact Rudy or Caleb.
