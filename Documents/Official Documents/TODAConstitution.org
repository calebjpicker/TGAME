    The Chairperson will acknowledge those who formally notified they could not attend the meeting.
    
*** Subsection V - Previous Minutes
    
   The Chairperson tables the minutes of the previous meeting making them open as a topic of discussion. 
   At this point the Chairperson will ask the members to adopt the minutes. 
   If the Officers do not agree that the draft minutes hold accurate, corrections may be suggested.

*** Subsection VI - Business from Previous Minutes
    
    Often the issues for Business arising from the Minutes of the Previous Meeting get listed in the agenda. 
    Any reports, pieces of information or other matters of substance that got requested at the previous meeting get debated and a vote gets taken on the appropriate action to take.

    The Chairperson presents a piece of correspondence to the meeting by putting a motion that the meeting "receive the correspondence". 
    This is an acknowledgment by the meeting that the correspondence as been formally received and that it may now be discussed and acted upon, if necessary.
    If correspondence sent to the meeting is considered offensive, the meeting can vote on a motion, "not to receive" it. 
    Alternatively, the meeting can decide that the correspondence should be "received and lie on the table". 
    This means it will not really be dealt with. 
    It is effectively in limbo until such time in the future that it is "taken from the table" and discussed.
    
*** Subsection VIII - Reports 
   
    Reports and submissions that have been written for the meeting or include information relevant to the work of the meeting are tabled and discussed. 
    A motion is required to be put that a report be received.

    Motions are able to be put for or against the recommendations of the report or ask the author to consider further issues or reconsider issues on the basis of particular information.
    A member of a meeting can even put forward a motion to change the wording of a report or submission.
   
*** Subsection IX - General Business
    
    General business items are announced singly by the Chairperson and a discussion or debate follows each one. 
    Motions that suggest methods of resolving issues are put forward and to a vote. 
    Once the motions receive a simple majority, or a majority as defined in the standing orders, they become resolutions. 
    Sometimes amendments to a motion are put forward. 
    Only after the amendments are debated and voted upon can the revised substantive motion be brought to the vote. 
    In the case of more formal meetings, general business consists of motions that are moved and seconded by participants of the meetings. 
    In most meetings however, the need for a member to support a motion is ignored.
   
*** Subsection X - Other Business
    
    It is at this point in time, that the members are able to raise issues they feel are important. 
    These include any items which were not listed on the agenda. 
    No extremely important or complex issues should be raised unannounced during this part of the meeting. 
    If an urgent matter must be dealt with by the meeting, 
    the Chairperson should be informed before the meeting begins. 
    A revised agenda can then be drawn up in the time that remains before the meeting is due to begin. 
    If the Chairperson feels that any of the issues brought up for discussion are too complex or troublesome, 
    he may call for another meeting to discuss the issue or 
    alternatively, put it on the agenda for the next scheduled meeting.
   
*** Subsection XI - Adjournment
    
    Once all the issues have been put forward and discussed,
