Section II are facilitation meetings

read through section II as it is currently (copied from a website)

agenda is available at least one week in advance

meeting times are determined a semester in advance (maybe not a full semester)

option for calling impromptu/urgent meetings

simplify this section (don't need to be a paragraph long), consider bullet points

keep in mind something that will guarantee that facilitator meetings will be done in a timely manner

add in someting about what chairperson does

chairperson guides the meeting through agenda

simplify subsection V and VI



Subsection VII suggestion box, it's place in meeting is symbolic and shows we are taking community suggestions into account before any and all other business

consider changing subheadings (e.g., remove subsection so that it aligns iwth rest of document)

** Article VI

we can work on this at a later date
