# I read through the RSO handbook, We should define the functions of the basic functions of President, Secratary, and especially the Treasurer. Also we need to define how we will handle financial matters here and not the bylaws.

** Preamble

To educate the community about the cycle that improves society, TODA uses tabletop games.

Every day, individuals and communities contribute to a cycle that improves society: They design, play, and test.  
For design, artists and engineers create solutions to society’s problems.  
For play, individuals and businesses use solutions to improve lives.  
For test, scientists, philosophers, and writers create knowledge that enhances design.  

Design. Play. Test.

When individuals and communities understand this cycle, they can collaborate with each other to improve society.  
Tabletop games are physically and computationally constrained, and thus provide a simpler medium to educate about design-play-test.  
For these reasons, we structure and establish TODA.

#revision1

Tabletop games are fun.  They bring people together and tear them apart.  They offer easy victories and challenging ones.  They simplify and then complicate communication.  They teach us alliance and deception, strategy and negotiation, and diplomacy and assertiveness.  They teach us about societal plights, historical battles, and economics.  In short, tabletop games allow us to explore ourselves and others, to learn and demonstrate knowledge, and to discover new interests and ways of thinking--all of which improves our own and others' lives.  

Tabletop games attract more people each day.  The more people that get together, the more there is a diversity of philosophies and interests.  These include interests to create and design, to analyze and illuminate, to socialize and interact, and to develop and teach.  At TODA, we acknowledge and embrace each person's philosophies and interest.  Moreover, we embrace each new person because they magnify and enhance our existing philosophies and interests.  

Up until now, there has been little to no structure to support the wide variety of passions and interests that people have.  With tabletop games and its players at the center, TODA aims to provide such a structure.  This structure is at once supportive and adaptable to the ever-changing diversity of philosophies and interest; this is a structure that grows as people grow.  For these reasons, we do establish and form TODA.

** Section II - TODA Officer Meetings 
  
*** Subsection I - Chairperson
  
    For all Officer meetings, the default chairperson shall be the President. 
    In the event that the President cannot fulfill the duties of chairperson, another Officer will act as chairperson. 
    The TODA Bylaws describe the procedure for deciding the Officer that will act as Chairperson.
    
*** Subsection II - Standing Orders 
    
    The TODA bylaws shall describe the standing orders for officer meetings. 
    Meetings will follow standing orders, unless a point of order is called to suspend standing orders.
   
*** Subsection III - Agenda 
    
    Prior to each meeting, the chairperson shall put items on the agenda and then give a finalized agenda to the Secretary. 
    The Secretary shall post the finalized agenda two days prior to the meeting.
    
*** Subsection IV - Opening and Quorum
   
    The meeting will not begin until the Chairperson declares a quorum. 
    A quorum will require at least ⅗ of the registered Officers. 
    If a quorum cannot have declaration within 30 minutes of the meeting’s designated starting time, 
    the meeting shall get called again for a similar time and place the following week. 
    If less than ⅗ of Officers attend the reconvened meeting, then no meeting can be called to order.
    If a Chairperson has not taken the chair 15 minutes after the designated starting time, 
    the next Officer in command that is also present at the meeting shall use the procedure for deciding who will act as chairperson, 
    as outlined in the TODA Bylaws.  
    The Chairperson will acknowledge those who formally notified they could not attend the meeting.
    
*** Subsection V - Previous Minutes
    
   The Chairperson tables the minutes of the previous meeting making them open as a topic of discussion. 
   At this point the Chairperson will ask the members to adopt the minutes. 
   If the Officers do not agree that the draft minutes hold accurate, corrections may be suggested. 
   The acting Secretary shall note the suggested corrections. 
   The Chairperson shall ask the Officers to vote to adopt the minutes with the suggested corrections.
   Once the minutes have become adopted the Chairperson shall sign every page of the minutes and hand them to the acting Secretary for filing.
   This time does not hold appropriate to indulge in debates on decisions which were made at the previous meeting. 
   Anyone who wishes to change a motion shall wait until the same subject arises in the general business of the current meeting or raise it in the part called "Any Other Business".
    
*** Subsection VI - Business from Previous Minutes
    
    Often the issues for Business arising from the Minutes of the Previous Meeting get listed in the agenda. 
    Any reports, pieces of information or other matters of substance that got requested at the previous meeting get debated and a vote gets taken on the appropriate action to take.
  
*** Subsection VII - Suggestion Box 
    
    Any letters, facsimiles and the like, which have been received by the committee are discussed here. 
    The Chairperson should summarize correspondence which cover similar issues, or express similar opinions and discuss them as a single issue.
    The Chairperson presents a piece of correspondence to the meeting by putting a motion that the meeting "receive the correspondence". 
    This is an acknowledgment by the meeting that the correspondence as been formally received and that it may now be discussed and acted upon, if necessary.
    If correspondence sent to the meeting is considered offensive, the meeting can vote on a motion, "not to receive" it. 
    Alternatively, the meeting can decide that the correspondence should be "received and lie on the table". 
    This means it will not really be dealt with. 
    It is effectively in limbo until such time in the future that it is "taken from the table" and discussed.
    
*** Subsection VIII - Reports 
   
    Reports and submissions that have been written for the meeting or include information relevant to the work of the meeting are tabled and discussed. 
    A motion is required to be put that a report be received. 
    This means that the report exists, as far as the meeting is concerned, and a discussion or debate may now take placed on the contents, interpretation and recommendations of the report. 
    Motions are able to be put for or against the recommendations of the report or ask the author to consider further issues or reconsider issues on the basis of particular information.
    A member of a meeting can even put forward a motion to change the wording of a report or submission.
   
*** Subsection IX - General Business
    
    General business items are announced singly by the Chairperson and a discussion or debate follows each one. 
    Motions that suggest methods of resolving issues are put forward and to a vote. 
    Once the motions receive a simple majority, or a majority as defined in the standing orders, they become resolutions. 
    Sometimes amendments to a motion are put forward. 
    Only after the amendments are debated and voted upon can the revised substantive motion be brought to the vote. 
    In the case of more formal meetings, general business consists of motions that are moved and seconded by participants of the meetings. 
    In most meetings however, the need for a member to support a motion is ignored.
   
*** Subsection X - Other Business
    
    It is at this point in time, that the members are able to raise issues they feel are important. 
    These include any items which were not listed on the agenda. 
    No extremely important or complex issues should be raised unannounced during this part of the meeting. 
    If an urgent matter must be dealt with by the meeting, 
    the Chairperson should be informed before the meeting begins. 
    A revised agenda can then be drawn up in the time that remains before the meeting is due to begin. 
    If the Chairperson feels that any of the issues brought up for discussion are too complex or troublesome, 
    he may call for another meeting to discuss the issue or 
    alternatively, put it on the agenda for the next scheduled meeting.
   
*** Subsection XI - Adjournment
    
    Once all the issues have been put forward and discussed,
