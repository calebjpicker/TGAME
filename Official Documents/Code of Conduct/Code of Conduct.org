#+Title: Code of Conduct
* Etiquette

Etiquette is the customary code of polite behavior in society or among members of a particular profession or group.
For our group, games can get quite involved and immersive, so please remember to follow this etiquette so all members (including you) have a pleasant and exciting experience:

1. Be courteous.
2. If you have played a game, let other people play the same game.
